We have developed a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to personalize the scholarship search experience. This system employs powerful technologies, including semantic search and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), integrated with the nomic-embed-text model, to create a deep, comprehensive scholarship knowledge base. Based on key user inputs such as qualifications, financial need, location, and field of study, relevant scholarship details are precisely retrieved. The llama\ 3.2 model then processes this information to deliver precise, easy-to-understand, and context-aware recommendations. This solution bridges the critical information gap, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility by empowering diverse student groups—especially those from underserved communities—with timely and highly relevant scholarship opportunities.
